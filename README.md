# meeting-links
This is bookmark js code to redirect users to a meeting link specified in `links.json`.

To add it to your bookmarks bar, copy the code in `app.js`, create a new bookmark and paste the URL bar.

Some names of the meetings have been abbreviated so that it's easier and faster to type.

## Secondary accounts
